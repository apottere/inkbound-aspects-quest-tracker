# Inkbound Aspect Tracker

I got annoyed there was no quest tracker for the Aspects quest in Inkbound, so I made one.

## Installation

1. Copy the contents of [`bookmarklet.txt`](https://github.com/apottere/inkbound-aspects-quest-tracker/blob/main/bookmarklet.txt)
2. Create a new bookmark in your browser
3. Paste the contents of `bookmarklet.txt` into the URL field
4. Go to the [Bindings Steam Discussion](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2980301381)
5. Click the bookmarklet

## Usage

* Click on any ascension/augment you've unlocked to mark it as complete
* Click on the arrow to fold or unfold a binding section
